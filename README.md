Hover over pictures  
Scroll Fighters, or Click button to next fighter  

# Fighter Roster - hover/mouseover the pictures  
# Further Experiments with createElement() and constructor pattern functions  
# Gained some experience using addEventListener too... versus using a function from html onmouseover.  Had to utilize this since there is no html to launch an onmouseover event function from.  
# On PC only - double click fighter picture to see youtube clip popup  
# Hover mouse over fighter pic to see picture change, and other visuals
